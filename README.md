# VoiceChat-Proximity

‚ö† **Disclaimer:** This is a Proof of Concept. Some features are missing for a usable solution.

## Overview

This project implements **real-time positional voice chat** for an **MMO** using **WebRTC** and the **Web Audio API**. It enables voice communication where volume is dynamically adjusted based on player proximity, supporting both **3D spatial audio** and **2D distance-based attenuation**.

Key components:
- **AzerothCore MMO Plugin (C++):** Sends real-time positional data via WebSocket.
- **Go Backend:** Handles **data tailoring**, **WebRTC signaling**, and serves the web client.
- **Vue/Nuxt SPA Frontend:** Displays players and manages voice connections.
- **WebRTC Voice Chat:** Direct peer-to-peer voice communication.
- **Web Audio API Processing:** Per-peer spatial audio volume calculations.

## Comparison of Approaches

### ‚úÖ Custom WebRTC-Based Solution (This Project)
‚úî **No external software required** (fully browser-based)
‚úî **Supports mobile & desktop**
‚úî **Easy for users to set up** (no client plugin needed)
‚úî **Proximity-based volume scaling**

### üî∂ Mumble-Based Approach
‚úî **Cross-platform (Windows/Linux/macOS)**
‚úî **Well-established, and proven voice chat**
‚úñ **Requires client-side install**
‚úñ **Previous work depends on deprecated/archived documentation**

### ‚ùå Discord Proximity Chat (e.g., DiscordSRV)
‚úñ **Does NOT scale voice volume based on distance**
‚úñ **Can only move players between voice channels**

### ‚ùå Teamspeak-Based Approach
‚úñ **Requires a paid license for >30 users**

## Features

‚úÖ **Proximity-based voice chat** (volume scales based on distance)
‚úÖ **Supports 3D positional audio** (HRTF with Web Audio API)
‚úÖ **WebRTC peer-to-peer connections** for low-latency communication
‚úÖ **Server filters positional data** (players only see/hear nearby players)
‚úÖ **Scalable state management** to limit WebRTC connections and prevent flickering

## Missing Features

- Per-peer **gain control** (fine-tuning individual player volume)
- **Mute/unmute functionality**
- **Role-based access control** (e.g., GM mode)
- **Secure authentication** (e.g., secret/token-based access)

### üîó Mumble Documentation & Resources
- [Mumble Positional Audio](https://www.mumble.info/documentation/user/positional-audio/)
- [Guide to Creating a Plugin](https://www.mumble.info/documentation/developer/positional-audio/create-plugin/guide/)
- [Linux Build Instructions (Archived)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210228200327/http://wiki.mumble.info/wiki/BuildingLinux)

## How to Try It

### üèó Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/sogladev/VoiceChat-Proximity.git
cd VoiceChat-Proximity
```

2. **Build and run the backend**
```sh
make
```

3. **Run a mock client** (simulates the MMO server sending positional data)
```sh
make mockclient
```

4. **Start the frontend**
```sh
bun run dev
```

### üéÆ How It Works

- The **MMO server automatically connects** and transmits player positional data.
- **Player identification is based on GUID** (default setup supports GUIDs `8` and `9`). Adjust as needed.
- Players nearby each other can **hear each other** with **real-time proximity-based voice scaling**.
